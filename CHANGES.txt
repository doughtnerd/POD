The only changes made to the Apache POI Library is the removal of unnecessary files in order to slim down the size of this abstraction library.
The files/folders removed are as follows:
- poi-examples-3.XX.jar
- poi-excelant.jar
- poi-scratchpad.jar
- ./docs/

Licenses and notices for all used programs are included in the root directory of the repository.
