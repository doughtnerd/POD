             ==============================
                   POI Release Guide
             ==============================


(I) Prerequisites

   1. You should read the <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/release.html">Apache Release FAQ</a>
   2a. You must have shell access to people.apache.org; and you should
       have key-based authentication set up
       1. Generate ssh key with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
       (e.g. <a href="http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html">how to</a>.)
       2. Add contents of id_rsa.pub to SSH Key (authorized_keys) line on https://id.apache.org/
       3. ssh -v username@people.apache.org
          Verify authenticity of host: https://www.apache.org/dev/machines
       4. Only sftp access is necessary
   2b. You must be a member of the committee group
   3. Release manager must have their public key appended to the KEYS file checked in to SVN and the key published on one of the public key servers.
      More info can be found here: <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html">https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html</a>
   4. You must have both Java JDK 1.6 and Java JDK 1.7+ installed and active.
   5. You must have the following utilities installed on your local machine and available in your path:
          * <a href="www.openssh.com">ssh</a>
          * <a href="www.gnupg.org">gnupg</a>
          * <a href="www.openssl.org">openssl</a>
      For Windows users, install Cygwin and make sure you have the above utilities
   6a. The POI build system requires two components to perform a build
          * <a href="https://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>
          * <a href="https://forrest.apache.org/">Forrest</a>.
      Currently, Forrest needs to be 0.5.x (prefer 0.5.1), Ant 1.8+ should be fine
      Make sure FORREST_HOME is set.

   6b. To deploy with Maven, you should have the latest stable Maven 2.x.
        POI 3.10-beta2 was deployed with Maven 2.2.1.

   6c. Ensure you can log in to https://repository.apache.org/ with your Apache
        credentials, and that you can see the "Staging Repositories" area on
        the left hand side.

   6d. Ensure your ~/.m2/settings.xml contains a server entry with your
        Apache credentials in, to be used for uploading. Something like:

{code:xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0">
  <servers>
        <server>
            <!-- used for uploading to nexus staging repository and svn commit -->
            <id>apache-id</id>
            <username>apache-userid</username>
            <password>apache-passwd</password>
        </server>
        <server>
            <!-- used for signing the releases -->
            <id>poi-signing</id>
            <username>keyid (key fingerprint, no spaces)</username>
            <passphrase>password</passphrase>
            <privateKey>../.gnupg/secring.gpg</privateKey>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
{code}

   6e. It's a good idea to check at https://builds.apache.org/view/POI/
       that Jenkins is in a good state (i.e. most recent build passed
       and is up to date with SVN). You probably also want to e-mail
       the dev list with a note to say you're building a release.

   7. Before building, you should run the "rat-check" build task, which
      uses <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/rat/">Apache Rat</a>
      to check the source tree for files lacking license headers. Files
      without headers should be either fixed, or added to the exclude list

   8. Check file permissions are correct in SVN.
      There can be  files in the SVN tree marked executable (have the
      svn:executable property set), but which should not be. Checking them
      out will cause the executable bit to be set for them on filesystems
      which support it. The flag can be removed in batch using

{code}
$ svn pd 'svn:executable' $(find -name .svn -prune -or -type f ! -name \*.sh \
 -print0 | xargs -0 svn pg 'svn:executable' | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
{code}

   9. Before building, ensure that the year in the NOTICE file is correct,
      and review any new or updated dependencies to ensure that if they
      required LICENSE or NOTICE updates then these were done.

  10. Ensure that the changelog is up to date

  11. Ensure that the KEYS files in the dist areas are up-to-date with the
      latest ones in svn:
      https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/KEYS
      https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/KEYS
      Dist is a regular svn repo that can be checked out and committed to.
      To upload to dist: https://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution


(II) Making release artefacts
  This is mostly automated with a sequence of 3 release-prep ant targets.
  Run these commands from a clean checkout of https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk

  1. The following command will update the documentation and create/download the tag (needs a Java7+ environment)
     using your Apache credentials stored in ~/.m2/settings.xml.
     {code}
     ant -Dversion.id=3.15-beta1 release-prep1 (beta release)
     ant -Dversion.id=3.15 release-prep1 (final release)
     {code}

  2. Compile the dist (needs a JDK6 environment, sudo update-alternatives --config java)
     {code}
     ant release-prep2
     {code}

  3. Upload to the nexus repo and to the svn release candidate repo  (needs a Java7+ environment)
     The nexus repo is located at https://repository.apache.org/
     The release candidate repo is located at https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/(3.15-beta2-RC1)
     {code}
     ant -Dversion.id=3.15-beta2 -Drelease.rc=RC1 release-prep3
     {code}

  4. Summarise key changes, and any backwards incompatible ones,
     in the partially auto-generated build/dist/RELEASE-NOTES.txt
     which needs to be committed separately

  5. validate signatures

Check your signed files

{code}
find . -name "*.md5" -type f -execdir md5sum -c {} \;
find . -name "*.sha1" -type f -execdir sha1sum -c {} \;
find . -name "*.asc" -exec gpg --no-secmem-warning --verify {} \;
{code}

 (III) Calling the vote:

   1. The release manager should call the vote
   2. Include the URL of the release artifacts
   3. Include the time for the vote to run (3 day minimum, can be longer)
   4. Provide guidance on what needs to be checked
   5. Complete a tally, and send a result once the time has passed

 (IV) After the vote:

In the release area of the dist repo:
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/release/   (FINAL)
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/dev/       (Alpha/Beta)
Remove the previous release

Next, svn move the files from the /dist/dev/ area to the appropriate
/dist/release/ area

FIXME: The release directory structure has changed.
The commands need to be updated
example:
$ svn rm -m "remove the previous release" \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/dev/src \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/dev/bin

$ svn mv -m "move staging files to the release area" \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/bin \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/src/  \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/poi/dev/


Log into https://repository.apache.org/ and go to the "Staging Repositories" area.
Find the "orgapachepoi" entry, check it has the right content, then Close the repository.
When that completes, Release it.

2. Wait for the distributions to appear on your favourite mirror

3. Wait for the maven artifacts to appear on Maven Central, and ensure
   they work:

Create a simple project and make sure the release artifacts are accessible
by maven:

{code}
$ mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.apache.poi.scratchpad -DartifactId=maven-test
cd maven-test
{code}

edit pom.xml and add the release artefacts to the project dependencies:

{code:xml}
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
      <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
      <version>3.11-beta1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
      <artifactId>poi-scratchpad</artifactId>
      <version>3.11-beta1</version>
    </dependency>
{code}

edit src/main/java/Test.java and add this:

{code:java}
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Workbook;
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.WorkbookFactory;

public class Test {}
{code}

{code}
mvn compile
{code}

You should see [INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL in the end, which tells you that
the jars could be downloaded fine.

4. Edit the website homepage and list the new release there. If a full release,
   remove older full releases and all beta releases. If a beta release, keep
   the last full release, and replace any other beta releases

5. Edit the website download page, and list the new release there. This should
   reference the checksums, so take care when updating
{code}
# the following generates a download-snipplet.xml to be copy&pasted in the download.xml
ant update-download -Dversion.id="3.15-beta2" -Dreltype=dev -Drel_date="02 July 2016" -Dfile_date="20160702"
{code}

6. Build site using a recent version of Java 1.6 or 1.7 (must be after the fix
   for TA13-169A).
   Commit the site changes to svn, and publish live

7. Don't forget to upload the latest version of the site and javadocs

8. Send announcements:
 - to poi-user and poi-dev lists
 - to announce@apache.org

Note, announcements should be sent from your @apache.org e-mail address.

9. If this is a final release, in Bugzilla, add a new -FINAL version and the
   next -dev version. Also close the n-2 -dev version to new bugs.

10. If this is a final release, add it to the DOAP file too

11. Delete directory that held RC.

e.g.
{code}
svn delete -m "delete empty RC directory for 3.10-beta2" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/3.10-beta2-RC1
{code}
